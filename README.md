##  :link: **Introduction**
From the beginning, we all were very passionate about these topics: sustainability, environment. We think it is really important to raise awareness and thereby understand the effects of climate change.

This is the reason why we feel like it is crucial that people start to empathize with nature in improving attitudes toward the environment. That’s why education is key, especially for young people who will be soon in charge of making important decisions.

##  :link: **Features**
This is our new app concept: a trivia game app in which friends can compete and improve their knowledge about ecology and the environment through the same mobile phone locally. 
There is still a playful experiences since in our opinion this is the best method to learn easily and in a quicker way  and also friends are able to play together and compete.
So in the future, we’re looking forward to implement:
an online ranking, which would be developed using the APIs of the game center
a single-player mode, implementing a daily challenge that would let the player earn rewards
multi-devices mode (multiplayer matches)
